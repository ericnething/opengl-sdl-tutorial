OpenGL and SDL 2 in Haskell
---------------------------

This is a tutorial for using the modern shader pipeline of OpenGL with SDL 2 in Haskell. I couldn't find any tutorials that cover using these two libraries in Haskell, although I did find an old tutorial that covered the fixed function pipeline (now deprecated) in OpenGL. I wrote this tutorial using guides written for the C API and matched them as best as I could with the high-level Haskell bindings.
